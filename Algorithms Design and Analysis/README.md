##Programming Question 4
Find SCCs in a given graph  
Time execution: 18 seconds (DFS) + 13 seconds (data read) with 5 M rows

##Programming Question 5
Find shortest path and it's cost in given undirected weighted graph with 200 vertices.  
Uses straightforward Dijkstra algorithm.  
Time execution: 0.1 seecond for 200 nodes and ~3700 edges.

##Programming Question 6
1. Implement a variant of 2-SUM algorithm, that finds distinct pairs of numbers that sum to any value in range [-10000,10000] inclusive.
2. Implement a Median Maintenance algorithm that bases on two heaps and stream of integers. Compare performance with slower list-slicing algorithm.
